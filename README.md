# etch-a-sketch

I made the Rock-Paper_Scissors project in 5 days. It was very diffcult to make it. But this project, which is more difficult
in logic, I made in 2 days. And now I understand how much practice is important. From now on I always must apply in practice what I learn in theory - it is indispensable. Also, I should focus less on UI and design aspects for now. They are cool and important, but I should learn the logic of the app - it is more important for now.

Basically, I created the basic layout of the page. Applied some css rules. I added javascript logic through DOM in form of event listeners. It was pretty simple and I enjoyed the process. I would like to make more projects and believe Odin Project won't disappoint me.

Note to self: practise thinking, problem solving. Once encountering a problem, do not rush to do try-and-see approach - it is bad. Do not rush to implement. Rather, sit down, calm yourself down, gather patience and think. Think thoroughly and deeply. Concentrate, focus. Implement the three step strategy - 1.Understand the Problem, 2.Plan the solution - break the problems into smaller simpler problems, 3.Write a detailed pseudocode.

For anyone reading it - learn from my mistakes and experience as well as others and yours.
